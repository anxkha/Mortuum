Mortuum

Author: Lucas Suggs
Original Concept: Jason Kapalka

I give full credit to Jason Kapalka for the original concept and design of this
game. He has granted his permission to reimplement the concept of the game to bring
it up to date with modern technology.

To compile this game you will need Microsoft Visual C# 2010 and Microsoft XNA
Game Studio 4.0.
